Steps for uploading data and code and running analysis in NSG portal

1. Create a folder "anxiety2021" in your laptop

2. create a subfolder "func" within "anxiety2021" folder

3. create subsubfolders for each subject (e.g., "10206" etc.) within "func"

4. copy 4d functional file (e.g., "rfMRI_REST1_LR.nii" ) and movement regressor file (e.g., "Movement_Regressors.txt") for each subject into subsubfolders created in step 3

5. copy "spm12" folder and and "masks" folder (containing .nii images of each ROI mask) into "anxiety2021" folder

6. copy preproc.m file into patent ("anxiety2021") folder

7. zip anxiety2021 folder

8. aceess NSG portal

9. go to Data> upload Data> select "anxiety2021.zip" and upload

10. go to Tasks> Input: select anxiety2021> Tool: select MATLAB R2016b on Comet> Parameters: preproc.m (filename), 0.75* n (runtime) [where n= number of subjects]

11. save and run the task
